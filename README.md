Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization (Matplotlib + Pandas)

This project explores and visualizes the Netflix Movies & TV Shows Dataset using Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib for data visualization.
The goal is to understand patterns in Netflix content such as release trends, genre distribution, content ratings, and more.

📁 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed multiple aspects of Netflix’s catalog, including:
📊 Movies vs TV Shows count
🧁 Distribution of content ratings (PG, R, TV-MA, etc.)
📈 How the number of releases has changed over the years
🎞️ Distribution of movie durations
🔍 Relationship between release year and number of shows
🌍 Top 10 countries with the highest number of shows
🖼️ Multiple subplots comparison
💾 Saving all final charts as separate PNG files
All visualizations are created using Matplotlib.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📊 Visualizations Included
1️⃣ Movies vs TV Shows
Shows how many movies and TV shows are available on Netflix.

2️⃣ Content Rating Distribution
Breakdown of rating categories like TV-MA, PG-13, R, etc.

3️⃣ Number of Releases Over the Years
Displays how Netflix content production has increased or decreased over time.

4️⃣ Movie Duration Distribution
Visualizes how long Netflix movies typically are.

5️⃣ Release Year vs Number of Shows
Helps spot patterns or outliers between year and count.

6️⃣ Top 10 Countries Producing the Most Content
Shows which countries produce the most Netflix content.

7️⃣ Combined Subplots
Used to compare multiple visuals in a single figure.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
Show ID
Title
Director
Cast
Country
Release Year
Rating
Duration
Type (Movie/TV Show)

📷 Sample Charts
(All charts are saved inside the project folder using plt.savefig().)

🚀 How to Run
pip install pandas matplotlib
Run the notebook:
jupyter notebook
Or run the Python script directly:
python netflix_analysis.py

🏁 Final Thoughts
This project helped me explore:
✔ Data cleaning
